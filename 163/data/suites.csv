"### Overview.

Duration can be one of month/months/week/weeks.  
If the cycle the slot belongs to has a monthly frequency, then the durations should be in `week|weeks`, i.e.

``` json
{
 ""duration"": ""4 weeks""
 }

 ```

if the cycle frequency is monthly, then the duration should be in `month|months` i.e.

``` json
{
 ""duration"": ""4 months""
