"### Overview.

Duration can be one of month/months/week/weeks.  
If the cycle the slot belongs to has a monthly frequency, then the durations should be in `week|weeks`, i.e.

``` json
{
 ""duration"": ""4 weeks""
 }

 ```

if the cycle frequency is monthly, then the duration should be in `month|months` i.e.

``` json
{
 ""duration"": ""4 months""

"### Overview.

Duration can be one of month/months/week/weeks.  
If the cycle the slot belongs to has a monthly frequency, then the durations should be in `week|weeks`, i.e.

``` json
{
 ""duration"": ""4 weeks""
 }

 ```

if the cycle frequency is monthly, then the duration should be in `month|months` i.e.

``` json
{
 ""duration"": ""4 months""
 }

 ```

> NOTE: Ensure the duration of slot freeze is not greater than duration of the cycle, i.e. a cycle with duration of 6 months, would not allow a slot freeze with duration of 7 months.","91","Slot freeze - invalid slot id","SLOT FINANCE - Users - QA","Sun Oct 05 16:10:03 UTC 2025","passed","Sun Oct 05 16:10:03 UTC 2025","Cycles > Slots Management > Slot Freeze","User","",""
